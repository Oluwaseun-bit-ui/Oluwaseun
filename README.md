## About Me üöÄ

I'm a passionate Software Engineer / Backend Developer with experience in Python. I love tackling complex problems, learning new skills, and collaborating with diverse teams to create innovative solutions.

- üå± Currently learning:  I'm also improving my understanding of Git/GitHub workflows and learning how to integrate AI tools to boost my development productivity.
- üî≠ Working on: Telemedicine app (alx project)
- üåç Languages: Python and English Language 
- üì´ How to reach me: t.oluwaseunofficial@gmail.com, 07080855371
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I'm a backend developer who finds joy in turning coffee into clean code. When I‚Äôm not debugging APIs, I‚Äôm probably helping a friend set up their tech, cracking dry jokes, or learning something new just for the thrill of it. I believe in growth, community, and making tech feel a little more human.
